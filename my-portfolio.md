<Comment: Idea for format: PPT: using the one you made for Jo (pencil pot and gardening): give each of the headings below an icon from the PPT set: create a page of these icons, like web page tiles, with the label underneath it: clicking the icon takes you to a slide where there is an image with the explanatory text underneath - portrait orientation.>
